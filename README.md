# Arry Tapiheroe Portfolio

*The contact form doesn't work just yet, because GitHub pages do not support PHP mail server. Therefore, a solution is on the way, in the form of plug-ins, or some sort. It's in the works!*

I created this portfolio from [Start Bootstrap - Freelancer](https://github.com/BlackrockDigital/startbootstrap-freelancer) theme, which I thought is an excellent, fully open-source, theme. Using my knowledge in HTML & CSS, I customised the styling. Although, I didn't really touch much of the JavaScript, especially because most of it uses existing Bootstrap, jQuery and Poppers JS frameworks. Saying that, it was really good to see how the JS came together. Even though it uses off-the-shelf frameworks, I thought the team has made a very elegant solution, which I was very happy to use.

### Things to do still:
1. Work on the "Contact Me" form - obtain a plug in and integrate into page
2. Continue with learning React.JS, and add React projects when ready
3. Update this Readme.MD with more stuff (EMOJIS, SCREENSHOTSSSS!!!)
4. Continual improvements... (also follow Start Bootstrap Github to see any updates)
